# Easy to contribute

To contribute, you do not need to know Javascript, React, or Docusaurus. You only need to know markdown.

## Structure of the documentation

The documentation is all kept in the `docs` folder. The `docs` folder is essentially the sidebar of the documentation. The `docs` folder contains folders for each of the divisions. Each division folder contains a `summary.md` file, which is the first page of the division. The `summary.md` file should outline the essence of that division, and all of their responsibilities and resources.
